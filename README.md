- üé® **Minimalism** - compact and simple interface
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible configuration** - ability to change parameters, language and messages

## Quick start

1. Copy all files to project directory
2. Make sure Python 3.6+ with `fastmcp` library is installed
3. Connect and enable MCP in IDE
4. Add rule for AI

## Usage in Cursor

1. Ask any AI request, for example: What is 2+2?
2. After AI response, MCP Dialog window will be called
