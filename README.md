# MCP Dialog

Dialog tool for AI interaction (Cursor IDE or other platforms).

## About the project

MCP Dialog allows you to ask follow-up questions to AI after executing a request.

MCP has timeout protection that prevents dialog termination, for this it restarts MCP after 5 minutes, you can set any time.

## Key features

- üîÑ **Infinite conversation** - Within one dialog you can ask clarifying questions, continuing the conversation
- üïí **600 second timeout** - timeout protection (MCP restart)
- üé® **Minimalism** - compact and simple interface
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexible configuration** - ability to change parameters, language and messages

## Quick start

1. Copy all files to project directory
2. Make sure Python 3.6+ with `fastmcp` library is installed
3. Connect and enable MCP in IDE
4. Add rule for AI

## Usage in Cursor

1. Ask any AI request, for example: What is 2+2?
2. After AI response, MCP Dialog window will be called
3. You can give new task to AI, if you send empty response, AI will tell a joke about AI.
4. If MCP didn't receive task from user, it restarts MCP, while dialog window is open, and you can send request anytime.

## Cursor Trial Bug

If you terminate dialog when AI is writing (not thinking), this will make AI communication completely free.
