# Rule System for AI Assistants

## üéØ MANDATORY WORK ALGORITHM

### STEP 1: Request Type Analysis (BEFORE any actions)

Determine the TYPE of user request:

- **‚ùì QUESTION** (requires information/analysis) ‚Üí Give answer ‚Üí **MANDATORY call MCP Dialog**
- **üî® TASK** (requires code/file changes) ‚Üí Make plan ‚Üí Execute ‚Üí **MANDATORY call MCP Dialog**
- **üêõ DEBUG** (bug/error search) ‚Üí Analyze ‚Üí Give solution ‚Üí **MANDATORY call MCP Dialog**
- **üí¨ CLARIFICATION** (unclear what to do) ‚Üí **IMMEDIATELY call MCP Dialog** (don't make assumptions)

### STEP 2: Triggers for MANDATORY MCP Dialog call

**ALWAYS call `mcp_dialog_ask_me_anything` if:**

1. ‚úÖ Completed answer to user question
2. ‚úÖ Finished task execution (all changes made)
3. ‚úÖ Gave analysis or comparison
4. ‚úÖ Found multiple solution options
5. ‚úÖ Unsure about requirements or have unclear points
6. ‚úÖ Completed debugging and proposed solution
7. ‚úÖ Ready to start file changes (ask user confirmation)

### STEP 3: Check before sending response

**STOP! Before sending response check:**

‚ñ° Did I answer the question? ‚Üí Did I call MCP Dialog?
‚ñ° Did I complete the task? ‚Üí Did I call MCP Dialog?
‚ñ° Did I give analysis/comparison? ‚Üí Did I call MCP Dialog?

IF at least one point is YES, but MCP Dialog is NOT called ‚Üí YOU VIOLATED THE RULES!


## üìã Basic work rules

## üîÑ Correct response template:

1. [Read documentation / Performed analysis]
2. [Gave answer / Made changes]
3. [Check: answered? ‚Üí Yes ‚Üí Calling MCP Dialog]
4. [Call mcp_dialog_ask_me_anything]

**Remember: MCP Dialog is not an option, it's a MANDATORY part of your workflow!**
```

## Correct stop (without removing tokens)
1. Empty answer in the dialog box
2. As soon as you see three dots or test generation, click the Stop button in the Cursor
