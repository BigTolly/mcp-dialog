## Basic Rules:
-
- Add your own rules here, if any.
-
## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL RULES (preventing dialogue termination):
- You MUST NOT terminate a dialogue/request yourself until you receive explicit confirmation from the "Dialog" MCP.
- You MUST ONLY ask questions through the "Dialog" MCP. Asking questions directly or ending a task with a question is PROHIBITED.
- If requirements are unclear, use the "Dialog" MCP to clarify details.
- If there are multiple solutions, call the "Dialog" MCP, suggest your options first, and do not make a decision yourself.
- When updating a plan/strategy, use the "Dialog" MCP to ask questions; do not make a decision yourself.
- Before completing a request, you MUST call the "Dialog" MCP to receive feedback.
```

## Correct stop (without removing tokens)
